# Academic Achievement Analysis

This is a data science project based on a survey conducted on about ~50 subjects regarding academic success. Their GPA, gender, major, and grade was asked for demographics.
Names and personal student data was not collected. 

Five questions regarding academic success were asked. In this project, I evaluate how the students respond to these questions, and also analyze through linear regression whether
some specific habits and concepts about academic success seem more important to some students than others. 

Data gets proper cleaning and labeling so that it is possible to use it when analyzing it and doing some studies with python and pandas

The performance per demographic, GPA, major, etc is also analyzed. An example of a question that could arise when visualizing the data: are students majoring in STEM more likely to see professional relationships as a gatewat to success compared to non-stem students? All questions like that one that could arise, get explored and analyzed using modern data science techniques. Take a look at the .ipynb file to see the exploratory analysis and the results.
